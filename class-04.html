                                    <p>Kinetic sculptures! Originally, I wanted to go for something very, very ambitious. However, this weekend my family took me on a surprise trip to NYC, and on top of that we're moving so time wasn't in my favor. I was missing a lot of materials (such as hot glue) that I would have had under normal circumstances so I tried to be resourceful with what I had.</p>

                                    <p>I decided to go for an origami crane kinetic sculpture, where the birds would fly over "clouds". I would have one motor control the entire thing. I wanted to try edge cams since they seemed very fun and a lot easier to implement with limited resources compared to other types of cams. It took longer than expected but I'm happy with the way it turned out! I tried to make it reasonably aesthetic and thought that it would be best if the motor was controlled by a simple potentiometer. I really opted for more of a mechanical and aesthetic approach to this because I think that's my weak spot and I think I learned a lot from this project. So, there was a lot of time spent on honing the edge cams and not really much on fancy coding or complex wiring. </p>

                                    <p>Hover over each of the images to see my steps and thought process behind them. Also check out the videos! :)</p>

I originally thought it would be easy but then I realized by hot glue gun was in a box being moved. So instead, I superglued 2 lego pieces together and wrapped it with tape for a smooth edge. I didn't realize this at the time, but it basically meant that the birds would pop up and down instead of a more gradual rise and fall.</p>

Anyways, these axles ended up being too long so I cut them down. Also, for the clouds, I decided it would work more like a "reverse crank". The biggest issue was trying to figure out how to constrain the edge cams without impeding on the mechanism, but I eventually figured out to make a wide base. </p>
